Controlling bulb with our mind

Our Project video googledrive ink ( https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o491oSnS1pbOMvaH0eNvZ90vIbVr72Ib/view?usp=sharing ). In this video we have switched ON and OFF light bulb with the help of our mind.
With the use of proper fundamental and advance science we can control any electrical device by our concentration and meditation power. With the multiple channel EEG headset we could add more nodes to the circuitry for automation purpose.
Due to higher price of EEG headset and additonal custom and excise duty makes it much more costlier. So, we tried cheapset nuerosky mind link headset fro accquistion of brain signals.
